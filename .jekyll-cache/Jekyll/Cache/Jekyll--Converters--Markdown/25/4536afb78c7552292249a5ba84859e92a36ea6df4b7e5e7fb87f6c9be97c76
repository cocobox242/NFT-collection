I"ï<p>So, I created my first NFT last night.</p>

<p>Here it is!</p>

<p>You can find it on OpenSea <a href="https://opensea.io/JaredFux">here</a>.</p>

<p>Russ Hanneman would have to be one of my favourite characters in Silicon Valley. This rounded rounded up billionaire (two shitty fucking commas for a minute there) flying in rented Citation Ultra, pissing in Jian Yangâ€™s vette, and busting a massive load butt-ass-nekked when minted in the billy club â€“ I think that we can all say that <strong>this guy fucks em I right!</strong></p>

<p>Although, from all of this, thereâ€™s just one thing that stands out to me â€“ that would be the Tres Comas Tequila that would then be gift the to the incubator. It would also later happen to sit one the keyboard of one of the laptops, pressing down on the delete key making them believe  that they were being hacked. As Russ Hanneman lifts the bottle of Tres Comas Tequila up and back down to continue deleting the server data, it then became clear that it was the Tres Comas bottle of tequila that held the mighty power at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Always believe in the liquor.</p>

<p>Russ fucks â€“ see you at RussFest later this year fuckers!</p>
